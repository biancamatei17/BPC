// I fallowed this requirements:
/* 
-	The 10 vector C programs along with the 10 C matrix programs and the 10 subprograms (5 functions and 5 procedures) and the multifunctional C program.
-	Elaboration of 10 subprograms C (5 function type and 5 type of procedure) characterized by correctness, optimality and complexity, which will be called within the same calling program C, with multifunctional option (the user can choose which option he wants from the 10 possibilities implemented through the 10 sub-programs).
-	Construction and call for subprograms in C (ANSI C ISO9899: 1990) - Functions and procedures; calling programs.
-	Elaboration of 10 C programs with matrices characterized by fairness, optimality and complexity
-	Problems with matrix in C (ANSI C ISO9899: 1990) - Issues with economic content.
-	Elaboration of 10 C programs with vectors characterized by fairness, optimality and complexity
-	7 Sorting methods (bubble method, selection method and insertion method), interclassing (known and unknown by iterations) and search (sequential and binary) in vectors.
-	7 Sorting methods (bubble method, selection method and insertion method), interclassing (known and unknown by iterations) and search (sequential and binary) in vectors.
-	Using Repetitive Structures - Problems with vectors and Alternative Structures - Algorithms represented by logical / pseudocode schemes */
